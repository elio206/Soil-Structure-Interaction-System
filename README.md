# Soil-Structure-Interaction-System
Dynamic numerical modeling of SFSI systems and seismic performance analysis.


This project was developed during a research internship at CEA Paris-Saclay and focuses on the numerical modeling of Soil–Foundation–Structure Interaction (SFSI) systems.
The study investigates the dynamic response of coupled soil–foundation–structure systems under seismic loading using OpenSees. Input ground motions are applied to the soil domain, and structural responses are analyzed through time-history simulations.
Post-processing is performed using Python to compute key engineering demand parameters and performance indicators such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), displacement-based metrics, and damage indices. 
--> The project aims to assess the influence of soil–structure interaction on seismic behavior and structural safety.
